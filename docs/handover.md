# Stash Curator handover

Updated: 2026-07-21 on `docs/showcase`.

## Current state

Curator is a working preview for Stash v0.31 with Python 3.12+. Public product,
architecture, privacy, and contributor guidance now lives in the main `docs/` pages.
Historical design and research records are retained in `docs/archive/` but are not
current guidance or part of the published site.

## Open acceptance work

- Complete installed desktop/mobile keyboard, playback, Prune, StashDB failure, and
  restart checks before calling the project 1.0-ready.
- After publishing, smoke-test every route and fetch the public `index.yml` source.

## Guardrails

Never delete or reset a sidecar to solve migration trouble. Never commit private
library data, IDs, credentials, reports, or evaluation notes. Curator's only Stash
mutation is explicit, reversible Prune tagging; StashDB access stays read-only.
